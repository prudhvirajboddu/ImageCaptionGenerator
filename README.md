# Image Caption Generator

This is our term project of Natural Language Processing for the fall semester. In this project, we have built a Image Caption Generator using the pretrained CNN embeddings with transformer decoder architecture. We have taken two pretrained CNN models to compare loss of the models and chosen the best model to serve the model.


## Deployment

To run this project with Transformer-ResNet model, download the model.pt files to root of this repo. Link to the models is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13RBbgC7KJu5f00cdSg1Q7q78vC38451q?usp=drive_link)

### setting up the environment

We have used python 3.11 Version to setup the environment.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the application, make sure you installed all the libraries required based on the code.

```bash
  python app.py
```
